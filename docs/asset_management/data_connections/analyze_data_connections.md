## Goal
{:.no_toc}
There are numerous goals to managing and curating data connections in a Qlik site -- especially in a development tier, where potentially many, many power users are creating data connections.

- The questions that this section will illustrate how to answer are the following:

- Which connections are no longer used?

- What connections have never been used?

- What connections have been deleted that used to be used?

- What are the most widely used data connections?

- Do we have duplicate data connections?

- Who owns what data connections?

- Who is using what data connections?

- Where are data connections being used?

- Via what mechanism are data connections being used?

In this section, there will be a how-to and an actions section for each question.

In essence, the goals is **to run a leaner, more performant, and more easily and holistically governed Qlik Sense site.**
